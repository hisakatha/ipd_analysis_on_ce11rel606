tandem_repeat_s4: Tandem repeats around gaps described in Supplementary Table S4 of the VC2010 assembly report.

# NOTE: It is important to use non-merged files after slopping/extension (*.slop20.bed.fa),
# rather than merged files (*.slop20.merged.bed.fa) for locating motifs near feature loci.
# I want to exclude occurrences of motifs at the edges of extended regions:
# --xxxxxXxxxxx------------
# ------------xxxxxXxxxxx--
# ---YYY-----YYY-----------
# X: feature locus
# x: extended region
# YYY: target motif
# The first motif should be captured, but the second should be ignored.
